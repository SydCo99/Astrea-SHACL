# Astrea-SHACL
Automated SHACL generator and validator 

## How to Use 
Simply clone the repo, open the Astrea_url2shacl.ipynb in any code editor, and place your ontology URL in the second cell (assign it to the variable ont_url, as specified in the file) and run all the cells. 

If you experience any file not found errors, make sure the shacl.ttl file outputs to the directory you're running the Astrea_url2shacl.ipynb file from, or edit the file path in the code directly.
